# Hi, I'm Harsha!

Final-year Computer Science Engineering student coding the future, one Python script at a time. I’m all about building slick, practical apps that make life better—like my **[Gym & Diet Planner App](#)** blending my love for tech and fitness. When I’m not slinging code, I’m crushing it in the gym, chasing that next PR (personal record *and* pull request).

- 🛠 **Tech Stack**: Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (and always learning more).  
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Vibe**: Discipline and grit, whether I’m debugging or deadlifting.  
- 🎯 **Goal**: Turning ideas into functional, dope projects that bridge tech and everyday life.

## Projects
- **[Gym & Diet Planner App](#)**  
  An application to plan workouts and meals, fusing fitness with tech. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask. Check it out for some serious coding gains!  

## What’s Good?
